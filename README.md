# WojakRumble - Solana Meme Token Website

A modern, responsive website for the WojakRumble ($WOR) meme token built on Solana. This project showcases the token's features, roadmap, and community aspects using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind-like styles), and JavaScript.

## About WojakRumble

WojakRumble is a community-driven meme coin that hosts live-streamed art competitions, where artists battle for crypto prizes, global exposure, and a chance to turn their work into digital collectibles and merchandise. Built on Solana for its speed, low fees, and eco-friendly infrastructure, WojakRumble combines the viral appeal of meme culture with the prestige of artistic craftsmanship.
